##This repository has been created as a tidy up excercise to tidy up the Samsung Smartphones data nd analyse the data. This script for analysis is present in the file named run_analysis.R. 


##The input data for analysis is assumed to be present in the UCI HAR Dataset in the current working directory. The directory structure is preserved as it is in Zip file

##The input files for the analysis are scattered in various files. All these information are collated and prepared for analysis in this script.

##The main inout for the files in a series of measuresments taken using the Human Activity Recognition smartphones.This is a 561 field measurements for various time and frequency domain variables.

###These files are test.txt and train.txt

##We are interested only in the mean and std measuremnts from the 561 measurements. To filter out the required fields features.txt file has been used. features.txt file represents the field names representing the 561 measurements. grep function has been used to filter out the required fields and gsub function to tidy up the field names which is also a requirement.


## There are various supporting files that has activity information for the measurements observed and also subject information

### These files are y_test.txt/ y_train.txt and subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt

##Collating the test, Activity, subject information column -wise gives a complete set of information. A row in this dataset represents the 561 time / frequencyt variable measurements made for a given Subject and given Activity.
### Collation is done for test and train datasets

##once the collation is done for test and train datasets, these files are merged to form a single dataset.

##The Activity stored in y_test.txt/y_train.txt is coded as numbers and each number represent a specific activity mentioned in ActivityLabels.txt.

## Once the collation is done, the files are merged to form a single file

## The average of the mean and std measurements are taken using the aggregate and mean function.
##Once the average is calculated for all Activity/ Subject groups, the result is sorted and saved in "results.txt" in current working directory.
